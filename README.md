# Anger
This school project game was made for people with anger issues, hence the name Anger. Representing a calm area, the game gives the player time to reappraise the anger. It's possible to pet a Plushy sheep, and do breathing exercises. The measure of anger is made quantifiable by measuring anger-level on a scale of 1 to 5, this data then gets saved in a .txt file.
